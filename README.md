A minimalist Cryptographic CLI tool

- Generate and keep track of your accounts (like wallets).
- It can be used for signing, encrypting and decrypting messages.
- Signing keys are diffrent from encryption keys and both are generated from a password that the user provides.
- Eeach account has an associated name that represents the keys.
- cypherBox files are in .config/cypherBox/
-  only one Account is selected at any time.
- A password is required whenever the user changes the account, decrypt and sign files, encrypting and verifying files require public keys only
- Visual Appearance might differ depending on your terminal color settings (consider it a feature ;=) )


### Todo

- [ ] support encryption for large size files
