A minimalist Cryptographic CLI tool

- Generate and keep track of your accounts (like wallets).
- It can be used for signing, encrypting and decrypting messages.
- Signing keys are diffrent from encryption keys and both are generated from a password that the user provides.
- Each public key is an account with an associated name.
- cypherBox files are in .config/cypherBox/
- Storing output files is in one of the following directories (Decrypted, Encrypted, Signed).
- Only public keys are stored and only one private key is selected at any time.
- Visual Appearance might differ depending on your terminal color settings (consider it a feature ;=) )
